class LocalTCP(asyncio.Protocol):
    '''
    Interface for stream protocol.

    The user should implement this interface.  They can inherit from
    this class but don't need to.  The implementations here do
    nothing (they don't raise exceptions).

    When the user wants to requests a transport, they pass a protocol
    factory to a utility function (e.g., EventLoop.create_connection()).

    When the connection is made successfully, connection_made() is
    called with a suitable transport object.  Then data_received()
    will be called 0 or more times with data (bytes) received from the
    transport; finally, connection_lost() will be called exactly once
    with either an exception object or None as an argument.

    State machine of calls:

      start -> CM [-> DR*] [-> ER?] -> CL -> end

    * CM: connection_made()
    * DR: data_received()
    * ER: eof_received()
    * CL: connection_lost()
